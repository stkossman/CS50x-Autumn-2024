# CS50: My solutions for a course. Autumn 2024
This is CS50: CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science!

## Academic Honesty
> Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on(academic honesty). The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.

## CS50x Autumn 2024
This repository contains my solutions for Problem Sets to [CS50x's course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).
Every problem set achieved **more than 70%** after submitting.
Read *readme* files if it is inside of week folder.
