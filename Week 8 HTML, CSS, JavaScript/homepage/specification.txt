JavaScript and Bootstrap:
The JavaScript snippet listens for a click event on an image inside the .about_container class and applies a "bounce" animation.
The bounce effect is defined using @keyframes in the main.js file, and this effect adds a playful interaction,
improving the user experience by drawing attention to the image when clicked.

Bootstrap is used to handle the modal and button elements easily.
The modal is a component that allows the page to display an overlay window for additional content, which is triggered by clicking the "Learn more" button.
The button's data-bs-toggle and data-bs-target attributes work with Bootstrap's JavaScript to show or hide the modal dynamically.
Bootstrapâ€™s grid system is also implied in the flexbox structure and layout, which makes responsive design simpler.
