If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

We can make assumption based on average energy, valence and danceability:
Energy: average energy is 0.65906
Valence: average valence is 0.484443
Danceability: average danceability is 0.71646

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Averaging energy, valence, and danceability oversimplifies the listener's preferences, missing variations in mood and genre.
A better approach would be clustering songs by mood, weighting averages by play count of a certain song.
